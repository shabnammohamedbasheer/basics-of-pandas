After reading the 1st and only review for this product (which was a 5 star...I think the customer might have been trying to get someone else sucked into buying it!), I decided to try it. I purchased 4 jars. BIG mistake! This is the WORST TASTING Hollandaise I could ever imagine! Tried it at room temp, then tried heating it to see if the bitter taste would go away but to no avail. This stuff is horrible! The only nice thing about the product is the shape of the jar. I'm going to make a huge batch of my own home made Hollandaise and store it in the jars. Thought about giving the three unopened jars away, but I don't have any enemies I hate THAT much!

It's thick, rich and complex. I like it with yogurt, pancakes, fruit, lemonade, in cooking, and even by the shot. However, after reading about maple country and maple syrup culture, I toyed with the romantic idea of buying directly from maple syrup makers. I recently was able to do that. I ordered a gallon of maple syrup grade B from Bear Mountain Vermont Maple (that's the place I chose after some research). Their sugar bush is in a remote mountain that borders Quebec and has never been farmed. Although the syrup is not certified organic, no pesticides or insecticides are used anywhere in the area. These are really nice, honest people and it was a great experience ordering from them. The syrup is great. And the price is good too: 1 gallon is $60 (including shipping) and is shipped in two half-gallon BPA-free containers that have an oxygen barrier coating on the outside to help the syrup stay fresh longer. The service was fast too. I got the shipment just 4 days after I placed my order (I live in Northern California). So yes, I'm really satisfied. I am not ready to say that I prefer this syrup to Coombs Family Farms'. They're both really good in my opinion.

We no longer give him meals in a bowl, but either in this toy or in a Buster Cube. We prefer this to the Buster Cube when we are watching TV because it is less noisy. The Tug-a-Jug is solidly constructed.  We've had ours for a month so far, and have used it nearly every day.  It is absolutely worth the twelve dollars it is currently selling for.<br /><br />The medium/large size hard plastic bottle is about the size of a large (32 oz) sports drink bottle.  As the dog tugs the rope and manipulates the bottle, bits of kibble - or whatever you want to put in it - come out.  You can also change the level of challenge by putting ping pong balls or other things in the bottle.<br /><br />Hobbes is a 60 lb Lab mix, and a cup of kibble will last him about fifteen minutes.  In a bowl, the same amount is gone in seconds.  It's a great way for him to have some mental stimulation and settle down in the evening before bed.  Because he loves it so much, it's a great training aid.  At a minimum, he sits politely to ask for it.<br /><br />UPDATE: (September 2, 2011) Hobbes chewed right through the rope a month or so ago. However, we removed the remnants of the rope and put in more ping pong balls to plug the hole. This way we haven't had to buy a new one and he still enjoys it every night."

It was on sale and I actually did a double take and returned to check out the display. It was filled with bags of fancy nut mixes by Sahale Snacks.  I had been trying to wean myself off sweets by substituting nuts and other trail mixes for candy whenever I got the munchies.  Sahale snack mixes looked like the fancy, upscale ""town mouse"" to my regular, boring ""country mouse"" trail mixes.<br /><br />The one that caught my eye was Sing Buri with cashew, pineapple, peanut, lemongrass and Chinese chili. The ingredients definitely made my mouth water, but the picture on the front is what sold me: a heaping bowl of delicious sweet and savory looking cashews and dried pineapple. The bag was pretty expensive at $5.99 on sale for 5 ounces, but I was definitely hooked at that point and decided to give it a try. I didn't even wait to get home, but opened up the bag in the car and started snacking right away. It was amazing!<br /><br />The more I looked into Sahale Snacks, the more I liked. On the website, the story is told of the two founders hiking up Mt. Rainier in Washington State, dreaming of something beyond the regular peanut/raisin/m&m combo that was their trail mix. What resulted was a snack mix that was indulgent and healthy.<br /><br />These snack blends are a little pricy, but in my opinion, totally worth it. This would be a wonderful nut mix to offer to friends and guests when entertaining. This is a high brow snack that you or your guests will love."

Same thing after only one greenie. He's an EXTREMELY healthy cat, very active and has never had a single health problem, but these made him so sick. After he threw up he wouldn't eat for two days. I was going to take him to the vet, but he perked back up, and started eating normally (hasn't thrown up once since).<br /><br />Obviously it's not like this for every cat, but I looked into it further and if you read reviews from other major sellers there are many problems like this in perfectly healthy cats.

The problem is, this very same cat (Fred) loves to gobble down anything he can find, especially leftovers from the other two.  I've started feeding this to my other two cats that don't have the condition, as a preventative measure, and also to feel safe feeding them all at the same time and not having to worry if Fred picks up their scraps.  I adopted him as an adult, and I think the people that had him as a kitten starved him or fed him a lot of ""people food,"" as I've caught him eating the weirdest stuff -- from pizza to sugar cookies to jalapenos.  This also might explain why his system is a little messed up.<br /><br />Frisky's also has a ""Special Diet"", which is cheaper and therefor probably not as good for kitties.  I ordered that, too, just as a back-up if my other two wouldn't eat Proplan.  I would say they all preferred ProPlan over Frisky's Special Diet (except Fred, who would gleefully scarf down hot garbage if he could get his paws on it).  Cats like what they like, and my cats have slightly more expensive taste -- again, except for Fred, who has quite an indiscriminate attitude towards food.<br /><br />I spoke with the vet about possibly switching Fred from his prescription diet to ProPlan and they reassured me that this was a very good food for cats with urinary tract problems, too.  Fred is the least picky cat I know when it comes to food, so I would only switch if cost because an issue.  I love my cats and they have a great life with me, but there are very occasionally some months where I have to eat off-brand ramen so I can pay the bills....so sometimes my cats have to slum it with me.  They are pretty good sports about it.  :)  I am planning to keep feeding this to my other two cats, with extras on hand for Fred if necessary.<br /><br />The delivery option is GREAT to save on trips to the store, and you can ""subscribe"" and save a buck or so.  If you do the math right (I didn't the first time, whoops), you can ensure the new palate arrives just as your little friends are polishing off the last couple cans.

Sriracha is a hot sauce with flavor -- it livens up every dish you put it on.""<br /><br />There are many sellers offering sriracha on Amazon.com. I recommend you compare the shipping charges of each. You can save by buying in quantity (and sharing with friends and relatives). Many supermarket chains are now carrying sriracha for $5 or less per bottle, again depending on the size.<br /><br />Once only found on Thai or Vietnamese restaurant tables, a bottle of Sriracha (sree-RAH-cha) Hot Chili Sauce is now a telltale sign of a great eatery, whether it is on a sidewalk hot dog stand, a family hamburger joint or my favorite Asian restaurant.<br /><br />Last year, New York Journal News reporter Kara Newman provided some background about the condiment nicknamed ""Thai ketchup."" Here's an excerpt:<br /><br />[[The two most commonly-found brands are Huy Fong, which sports a white rooster on the label, and Shark. (Supposedly, the shark is in homage to the shark-infested waters off the coast of Sriracha). Shark brand is made in Thailand and is used widely there as well as imported to U.S. stores and restaurants. Huy Fong is made in California by a Vietnamese immigrant, David Tran, and is the U.S. favorite.]]<br /><br />Sriracha is made of sun ripened chilies that are ground into a smooth paste with garlic. The sauce is nearly as thick as ketchup, which makes the squeeze bottle a handy way to deliver a spicy kick to your favorite foods. Speaking of ketchup, a little sriracha can add a nice kick to ketchup or your favorite dipping sauce without overpowering the other ingredients.<br /><br />Newman's story featured recipes were adapted from Greg Gilbert, Jackson & Wheeler.<br /><br />Sriracha Remoulade<br /><br />1 cup mayonnaise<br />1/4 cup sriracha<br />2 tablespoons red wine vinegar<br /><br />Whisk together until smooth. Serve as a dipping sauce with fried calamari rings.<br /><br />Fried Calamari<br /><br />1/2 cup calamari<br />1 cup milk<br />1 cup flour<br />1/2 cup semolina<br />Vegetable oil for frying<br />Salt and pepper<br /><br />Soak calamari rings in milk for about 20 minutes; drain.<br /><br />In a bowl, combine the flour and semolina. Dredge the calamari in the flour mixture, and shake off the excess. Heat the oil to 350 degrees, and fry the calamari until golden brown. Season with salt and pepper and serve with Sriracha Remoulade.<br /><br />Sriracha Spicy Buffalo Wings<br /><br />6 chicken wings<br />Oil for frying<br />3 tablespoons Frank's Red Hot Sauce<br />1 tablespoons sriracha<br />1 tablespoons butter, softened<br />Baby mache or other lettuce to garnish<br /><br />Fry the chicken wings until crispy. In a bowl, combine the red-hot sauce, sriracha, and butter. Toss the wings in the sauce and serve. Garnish with baby mache or other lettuce.<br /><br />In summary, I grew up with pepper, salt and Tabasco pepper sauce on the table for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Did sriracha replace my bottle of Tabasco? Yes. Sriracha is hotter but with a light, sweet finish that sets it apart from the vinegar tang of other pepper sauces.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars"

456508,B002QZ2AZ0,A1U74I9FWDMGEW,Joshua,0,0,5,1347753600,My all-time favorite bagel-chips.,"I've tried a few varieties of Bagel chips, and by far, this is my favorite.  Most bagel chips use mini-bagels, cut horizontally.  You can tell because of the hole in the center.  Bagels are typically seasoned on the outside, sliced, then baked as chips.  If you get a chip that is close to the exterior of the bagel chances are good that you will get the seasoning (usually too much).  If you get an interior chip you will likely get too little seasoning (if any).  Some brands season the chips after they are cooked as well, which almost guarantees that you'll get far too much seasoning.<br /><br />Stacy's starts with regular, whole bagels; the same high-quality bagels that you will find on a supermarket or baker's sehlf.  Because these are sliced vertically, you get round chips that are all seasoned correctly on the outside ring.  Each chip is round and perfect for dipping or spreading.  I love regular bagels toasted with cream cheese, which is also good with Stacy's bagel chips.  However, these are good enough to warrant more creativity.  Try them with hummus, salsa, melted cheese--use your imagination.<br /><br />Yes, this is the same Stacy's that makes <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KGW2BY"">Stacy's Pita Chips</a>.  All of Stacy's products are very high quality.  If you are a fan of everything bagels, you will love these.  The <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QZ2AZ0"">Simply Naked Bagel Chips</a> are similar to the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KGW2BY"">Simply Naked Pita Chips</a>--simple, and delicious with dip. The <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QZ3XKG"">Everything Bagel Chips</a> are standard everything bagels, covered on the outside with seeds, onion, and garlic.

I just peeled myself off the ceiling after drinking a cup of this. This might be better named ""Double Sugar"" Flavor Hot Chocolate mix.<br /><br />First, the good stuff. There is no doubt in my mind that Ghirardelli continues to make a distinctive, excellent quality chocolate. The cocoa used in this mix is smooth, dark, fruity and aromatic. Nothing else like it that I've ever tasted.<br /><br />Now, the criticism. There is just too much sugar in the mix. The recommended proportion of mix to 8 oz milk is four tablespoons. (By the by, there is no powdered milk in here. You must add your own milk--or soymilk or rice milk--great option for lactose-intolerant types.)<br /><br />People, you are using a quarter cup of mix at 4 Tbs and most of the mix seems to be granulated sugar, which you can taste and crunch in your mouth if you sample the dry mix. Cutting down fifty percent on the mix gave me an acceptable cup of cocoa but...it was no longer double chocolate and it had naturally a poorer mouth feel and aroma.<br /><br />Double Chocolate Mix is some of the best cocoa I WOULD have had, if Ghirardelli could see their way to making a lower sugar version, and please, no sugar substitute, which I don't like to use.<br /><br />Summary; great chocolate flavor, unsurpassed.

A teaspoon of cinnamon a day lowered my blood sugar levels after eating a meal, i simply sprinkle it on my food or mix it in, it's mild enough that i sometimes don't even notice it's on my toast etc.<br />Higher insulin levels lead to less use of excess blood sugar (and sugar is stored in the body as fat), so a reduction in insulin after a meal is significant.

The purple packages don't even resemble meat so even though my cats will eat it, I didn't feel comfortable feeding it to them. The Purrfectly Fish makes a couple of my kitties violently ill (hence the neon pink vomit everywhere) but the Purrfectly chicken varieties seem to agree with all of them. No vomit, they eat a majority of the meat after lapping up all of the juices and grain free. My diabetic cat is no longer diabetic, and the fact that there is now a food in my home that everyone will eat is pretty amazing.<br /><br />My complaint - the packaging. I've tried the tip mentioned by others (storing them upside down) but there is just no way to get the pack open without a) having the juice squirt out on to one of the eager diners (though they don't let that slow them down), b) having the juice squirt and ooze all over my hands c) the juice splattering the wall d) me having to squeeze the package for the remaining bits of meat and juice as if I am milking a cow. I HATE feeding them because I always end up covered in chicken juice and bits and I know there is more in the package that I didn't successfully squeeze out. This in turn means that all of the pets will be trying to go through the trash when they are hungry looking for a few half squeezed packs so they can get another fix. There must be another interior material they could use for the packaging that would allow an easier 'release' of the food. . .Whiskas, you listening?"

To be fair, my Wife would probably give this a 4 or 5 Star rating.<br /><br />I have given this 3 stars, not due to poor quality, no poor taste - but rather being disappointed in reality meets expectations.  I am sure many will cry foul, that I hold this product to blame, but I think-it out this way: Reviews say this is the best Marzipan, Niederegger  will give me the ultimate Marzipan experience, experience falls short of expectations, therefore a 3 star rating.<br /><br />So why did this fall short, in my opinion 3 areas fell short: 1) Texture, 2) Flavor, 3) Sweetness.<br /><br />First to texture, I anticipated smoother and lighter than what Niederegger delivered.  This is a very rich, dense treat.  Subtle, yet kind of overbearing.<br /><br />Second is flavor - I anticipated a lighter, less earthy flavor.  While I really enjoy almonds, but this is almost almond overkill.  Its a very earthy flavor, subtle like almonds, but undeniable present.<br /><br />Third is sweetness - I was really expecting a sweeter treat, even with Dark Chocolate being the coating.  In my opinion, there is only a hint of sweetness, not a robust sweetness.  When I reach for sweets, I want sweet.  I did not want/expect an overly sweet experience like a candy bar, but maybe subtle fullness of a good peanut butter cookie.<br /><br />And just to really make a fan of Niederegger mad, I do enjoy these, but I just can't rate it any higher."

After about 5 minutes, the bone was thawed to the point it was dripping and could easily have holes chewed in the fabric.  When I went to refreeze it, my poor pup didn't understand why I was taking her toy and ended up becoming disinterested very quickly the next time I brought it out.<br /><br />Another issue I hadn't thought about until after freezing is how hard and heavy the bone becomes.

It had soft pieces of jerky mixed with annoying hard pieces of jerky. The meat has a nice fat to meat ratio, you know when you bite down on a fatty piece of meat. However, the hard pieces had tendon or sinew. On some pieces I could pull the silver sinew out and use it to floss my teeth. Not palatable at all. Generally the jerky is somewhat grainy due to the spices but is palatable. A strong peppery taste permeated the jerky. I felt like some of the pieces were not mixed properly, some pieces of meat were more salty than others.<br /><br />The taste is quite enjoyable. (I'm known to eat anything... & can acquire taste) If you don't mind fishing out the bad parts...<br /><br />However, my second bag developed some kind of mold. I started on the second bag without knowing that this bag contained a mold ball right in the middle of the bag. About half way through I found the moldy meat. I had read of this occurring in some people's product but I dismissed it as a freak chance.<br /><br />The mold is white, it reminds me of bread fluff. The mold is very bitter. I just reached into the bag for a piece of jerky & bit down on a moldy piece. I promptly spat it out and saw the middle part of the bag was fully rotten. IMHO.<br /><br />Would I buy this product again?<br /><br />No. a 50% chance of getting moldy meat... Well I don't wanna chance it."

I've tried other products for dogs containing glucosamine, but wasn't very happy about the animal products in them, because I know too much about where those animal products come from and how they're processed, and prefer not to feed them to my dog. (One reviewer of this product, wishing for a chicken or beef flavor, asked, ""What kind of dog eats salmon?"" The answer: mine, every day.  He loves it,and for twelve years old he's pretty darn healthy.)<br /><br />Unlike some of the dogs mentioned in other reviews, my dog loves the flavor of this.  The ingredients are exceptionally well thought out--they're not fillers.  For example, ginger and turmeric are known to have anti-inflammatory properties, but dogs may not particularly like them in their raw form. Omega-3 fatty acids are also effective.<br /><br />Does it help?  After two weeks, I'd say maybe; since my dog doesn't have a major problem, any change wouldn't likely be dramatic, but he doesn't seem quite so creaky.<br /><br />For a larger dog, the product, while reasonably priced considering the ingredients, can get a little pricey if you expect to use it consistently, and I believe with this type of supplement that's what you'll have to do if you want to get results and keep them. This 150-gram size will only last a few weeks. But I haven't found a better product of this type."

To my dismay, it's not, but it sure costs a lot more!  After four brews with the Davidson's, I'm very dissatisfied.<br /><br />First off, the color of the gunpowder pellets are no different between samples, but the Davidson's uses bigger pellets, meaning bigger, older fan leaves.  The Temple of Heaven (ToH) gunpowder green uses smaller leaves, so when you brew there appear to be many more leaves because there are.  The Davidson's often has several leaves and their attached stem rolled up into a single pellet.  The Davidson's also has significantly more dirt, dust, and loose stems in the package.  In fact, it looks like I got the bottom of the barrel.<br /><br />****  Your Quality Control Is Terrible, Davidson!  ****<br /><br />The idea that it is organic should have some impact on the flavor, but the Davidson's is more bitter, and the tea is orange/yellow after 3 minutes of brewing in RO filtered water heated to 170-180F in a French press.  The ToH tea is a greenish yellow, and has a better flavor with less bitterness.<br /><br />Overall, I am very unhappy with my Davidson's purchase.  The ToH gunpowder green is better quality for less than half the price!!!<br /><br />When compared to the other gunpowder green tea options available, Davidson's Gunpowder Green Tea is a 2 star gunpowder green tea for flavor that loses a star for poor pricing and very poor quality control."

Too many products labelled as spicy are not, have no kick, and are as bland as can be. Here, you do get a slow noticeable burn from the jalapeno. My preference? A bit more heat. But I understand that most consumers would prefer somewhat less than I would. Still, decent spicyness.<br /><br />All in all, I have been pretty happy with this product, in the few weeks since we first bought it. I now purchase a package each week in my foray to the local grocery store. . . ."

For whatever reason, I missed the pod image in the picture, so when I received this I ended up using several pods to create a full pot of coffee. This did impact anyone who is wondering what it might be like to brew one individual pod, which I will try to brew with my father's french press. Anywho, on with the review. I just wanted to be up front when I say that my experience might not be like that of someone who owns a Senseo.<br /><br />Smell-wise, this stuff is awesome. It smelled great when I was brewing it, which is honestly about 30-40% of what I (and many others) enjoy most about coffee. Taste-wise, this was pretty good. It's definitely a dark roast, so if you prefer a more mild flavor then you'll probably want to look elsewhere. (Not sure if Marley coffee has a lighter roast, but they probably should.) It's not Charbucks, so no worries about it being too roasted.<br /><br />I brewed this at work and after the pre-requisite jokes about a ""pot"" of coffee and such, we all set about to consuming it. Now while we do have to put up with some of the worst free coffee possible, it only serves to help us appreciate the good stuff when it comes along, and this is some good stuff and was pretty well received. I had a lot of people that came back and told me that they really enjoyed the brew. (For food items, if I can get a wider opinion, I try to do so because hey- not all opinions are the same when it comes to any product.) So if you have a Senseo that multiple people use or if you're considering buying a regular bag for multiple people to use, this is something you can get for a wide audience of drinkers.<br /><br />I have to say, this is something that I'd actually purchase with my own money later on down the line. It's a good coffee and while I don't base my purchases on the whole ""organic, fair trade"" stuff, I know that others do and I have to admit that it is nice to think that the coffee purchase potentially helped someone other than myself. (The whole organic, fair trade thing didn't really factor into my opinion, but I know that this is important to some consumers so I wanted to make sure to make a note of this since the product description for this didn't have any of this in it.)"

Most Mexican food is very spicy and often has a little kick, I have seen Mexicans that use Tapatio hot sauce on hamburgers, rice and soups and Tapatio packs a kick.  The Chipotle sauce is nice and bland which is how most people like their food but it really does not pack the kick that a typical authentic Chipotle sauce has.  I tried it on tacos which was not good at all and nachos which actually was pretty good.  If Taco Bell is your choice for burritos and tacos than you will like the Chipotle Sauce."

Schumacher ""Grey""",0,0,4,1278547200,"Good coffee, but needs a bit of cream","Melitta Caf&eacute; Collection Gourmet Coffee: Hazelnut Cr&egrave;me Brulee<br /><br />First of all, a summary, for those of you who only want the brass tacks: using a high-quality drip coffee maker, the result was a pleasurable but not perfect experience, and so I give this coffee four out of five stars. If you are willing to add good cream to your coffee, then I would even venture to give this blend a full five-of-five rating.<br /><br />Before I even opened the package, I was hit by the smell of its contents, the strong scents wafting through every tiny opening. The smell, however, was of cinnamon rolls, not of coffee. Cautiously cutting open the container, I put it to my nose and was rewarded slightly by the previously noted sugary odor mixed with a very gentle smell of ground coffee beans (the package didn't indicate the date of their grinding, but, having received them for review, I assumed they were relatively fresh.)<br /><br />I have to admit that I was a bit concerned about using the drip coffee makers because of the fineness of the grind, but nonetheless I approached them hoping for the best.<br /><br />One of the first things that struck my attention was the fact that the instructions on the side of the bag indicated a measure of two teaspoons of coffee per six ounces of water. The standard measurement for gourmet coffee is two tablespoons per six ounces. (Although two tablespoons per six ounces provides too strong a flavor for many people, it pulls out the best taste with the least amount of bitterness. Extra water should be added AFTER it has been brewed to lighten the coffee to the desired level. NEVER decrease the amount of coffee to make it less strong!)<br /><br />To properly determine the appeal of the coffee to the typical buyer, I decided to prepare the beans two ways:  (a) via a high-quality drip coffee maker using the ""two tablespoons of coffee grinds per cup of water"" measurement, and (b) via a more standard generic  drip appliance, using its recommended ""two teaspoons of coffee grinds per cup of water"" measurement.  I first tasted the results straight (without any added flavoring), and then with cream.<br /><br />Using the high-quality drip coffee maker, the results were quite satisfactory. The taste of smoky wood was definitely there, and the flavor brought to mind fire-roasted beans, slightly burnt to enhance their essence. The hazelnut flavoring was more of a scent than a taste, lingering on the tongue and in the nostrils after the rest has been swallowed.<br /><br />Good coffee prepared correctly should never be bitter. Never. So I was disappointed to find that there was, indeed, a small amount of bitter aftertaste in the cup I drank.<br /><br />Also to my disappointment was a bit of a sourness that permeated the entire experience, like the beans had been left to ripen a bit too long.<br /><br />To my surprise, one sensation that was not there was the sugar and cinnamon that hit me so hard when I initially opened the bag. I can only assume those flavors were run across the beans to provide a pre-brew experience to tantalize the potential buyer, but they didn't make it across after the water had been applied.<br /><br />So, as stated at the beginning of my review, using a high-quality drip appliance the result was a pleasurable but not perfect experience, and a good start for my tasting process.<br /><br />With the initial ""pure"" tasting complete, I added some cream to my coffee. The result was wonderful. All of the bad tastes were washed away instantly. No more sourness or bitterness. Granted, a coffee drinker should not have to rely on something external to wash away unpleasant side flavors, but in this situation it produced a cup I eagerly look forward to drinking again. Five out of five stars for that experience.<br /><br />Next, I turned to the ""department-store"" brand of coffee maker and used eight tablespoons (the equivalent of 24 teaspoons) with 12 cups of water. The result was passable. It retained most of the flavors of the stronger brewing but in a watered-down state. Unfortunately, the bitterness and sourness - the two worst flavors - came out in full force. Judging purely by this taste test, I would give the coffee at most three stars.<br /><br />Next I added cream and, to my pleasant surprise, it again completely wiped away all of the unpleasant flavors, leaving behind a delightfully light cup that flowed smoothly down my throat. Once more, five out of five stars.<br /><br />I should note that I gave the lighter version (with cream) to a friend who generally does not enjoy coffee, and she loved it, going so far as to say it was one of the best cups of coffee she had had in years.<br /><br />I generally don't like flavored coffees, but this one won me over as a good attempt and something I'm happy to keep on my shelf. Again I wish to note that I am disappointed that the addition of cream was a necessity in removing the very noticeable bad tastes from this blend, but at least they could be removed, which is more than I can say for many coffees out there.<br /><br />""Black as the devil, hot as hell, pure as an angel, sweet as love.""<br />-- Charles Maurice de Talleyrand (1754-1838) speaking of the perfect cup of coffee.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brianna<br /><br />Footnote from Grey: I agree with Brianna's review. This coffee is much improved with the addition of cream. However, I got a very noticable hazlenut flavor from the coffee."

The centers DO NOT dissolve in their stomach, and if they do not vomit them back up, they get constipated and cannot excrete, which leaves them in tremendous pain.  I have a Pomapoo (1/2 Pomeranian, 1/2 Poodle who is 10 months old) and he has been in pain for weeks because of this treat, and it broke my heart to know that I was the one keeping him in pain by feeding him these treats!! Maybe bigger dogs can digest them, but PLEASE PLEASE do not feed this product to your pet if you have a small dog! I thought it'd be a good alternative as he likes to chew and there is no rawhide in them, but the center does not break down, and he had one part lodged in his small intestine and another stuck in his stomach.

Otherwise great cat, but when she would yawn in your lap, you had to fight fainting.<br /><br />We took ""Dentabites"" more for fun since our cat loved other whiskas tempations we tried with her, but well, thought let's try to see if it really can do anything about her breath. After about a week of giving her dentabites, we noticed her breath ""improved"" and after 2 weeks it was amazing. Her bad breath is almost completely gone, or gone as much as it can without brushing teeth i suppose. We didn't change anything in her diet at the time so we were pretty sure it was dentabites that did the job. Also, since then, we've been feeding her various foods but keep the dentabites snacks and bad breath hasn't returned... one more point to be sure that Dentabites really work.<br /><br />Really great product. Just a few treats a day make enormous difference. Highly recommended."

There are presently three different flavors that blend dried herbs and spices,  to which you add oil and vinegar to make fresh dressing on demand.  The Napa Valley blend contains garlic, citric acid, tomato powder and, I believe I taste, oregano and thyme in there as well.  The total effect is similar to an Italian herb dressing.<br /><br />I was fascinated by the blend and experimented with several oil and vinegar combinations.  With the oils I tried canola, vegetable and extra virgin olive.  I teamed those oils variously with red wine, white wine, balsamic and cider vinegars.  In my opinion, the strong flavors of EVOO, red wine vinegar, and balsamic vinegar overwhelmed the spices.  My least favorite dressing base was the EVOO with red wine vinegar; the resulting dressing had an overwhelming olive oil taste, and the strong red wine vinegar seemed sharp and harsh with the herb/spice mix.  My favorite was the Napa Valley blend with cider vinegar and vegetable oil.  That combination seemed to best showcase the herbs and spices; just a nice smooth dressing.<br /><br />In addition to making the dressing, I tried using the blend on some boneless skinless chicken breasts.  One piece of chicken was put in a baggie with the Napa Valley prepared dressing for a few hours before grilling.  It turned out all right - what you would expect from an Italian dressing marinade.  However, using the mix straight from the jar as a dry rub seemed to give the chicken a much more intense flavor.  I just sprinkled it over the chicken and let it rest for 20 minutes before grilling.  The mix was also very nice tossed with some pasta and a drizzle of olive oil.<br /><br />Recommended."

The premeasured amount is both a positive and a negative.  like with anything else packed in singled-serve it costs a bit more than a jar (for example).  It also does not allow you to easily adjust for your own taste preferences.  I suspect that I'd like it better if I doubled the recommended amount, but that's all I can do; 1 or 2, or... I can not put in a 2 tablespoons vs .5 for example.  For me, this is a serious draw back.<br />In brief, it is a convenient product, makes a nice dinner very quickly, but i find it on the weak side and would switch brands of curry paste if I could get the other here."

Not really a big fan of the idea of  Bonsai. The packing/shipping materials kept it safe and sound (may want to open the box with a large trash bag around the box-packing peanuts galore) It looked very healthy and happy. As some other reviews stated about a week after receiving the plant LOTS and LOTS of tiny black bugs showed up. I have other inside plants and lots of outside plants so of course didn't want the bugs to spread. I squirted watered down dish soap (just a drop or two to a spray bottle of water) a few times, let it sit outside when we had large rainstorms. It lost a good amount of leaves (could be the bugs or could be the soap). Bugs died/washed away. After a week, new leaves started growing back. I waited another week and left it outside in the shade (sunburns very easily), later repotted it in a large pot. It's doing great, even though it's been through the wringer. I hope this helps anyone who has any of these problems."

400004,B002IEVJRY,A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2,Naomi (Storm),0,0,4,1333584000,I really enjoyed it - not a major coffee drinker,"I am not a huge coffee fan - I prefer my coffee in a dessert style: creamy and sweet. The Starbucks mocha Frapachinos (bottled) are usually the only coffee-esque drink that I like, and even those I only drink a few times a year. The illy issimo Cappuccino wasn't bad - it wasn't nearly as creamy as the Starbucks drinks, but it was also around a half of the calories, so there's a bit of give and take there. It's also not super sweet - many of the Starbucks drinks border on that thin line between really tasty and ""The sugar is melting my teeth"". The illy issimo is very safely stashed on the not-super-sweet side of the fence. Don't take that to mean there isn't any sweetness - I'd compare it to a Symphony chocolate bar versus a Hershey's milk chocolate bar. They both have very similar flavor profiles, but the generic Hershey bar is so much sweeter. I can't really say it's like a dark chocolate either, because the cappuccino didn't have a lot of the bitter undertones that the dark chocolates and espresso drinks tend to have.<br /><br />As for energy burst, I should preface by saying that I'm not much of a caffeine drinker any more. My normal drink is straight water, and at restaurants iced tea (unsweet). I think my body has stored up reserves of caffeine and sugar from my childhood days though - back when I drank a six-pack (or more) of Coke a day. That being said, the ""rush"" from the drink took a few hours for me to feel it (granted I had already eaten lunch and had a full stomach, which might explain the lag). But when it hit, it was a sort of ""giddy"" high, not like a super pixie-stick rush. I also can't say I experienced much of a telltale caffeine crash either, the extra energy just quietly bled away.<br /><br />All-in-all, should I decide to pick up a coffee drink, I wouldn't hesitate to get another one from illy issimo."

A lot of cooking TV shows mentioned using kosher salt but I never though much of it. But this salt is really different than any others I've had. I don't know if it is the process of making kosher salt, or the raw source ingredients, or the shape of the flakes, but every other salt I've had pales in comparison. I even thought it might be just my imagination, but I've had people come over and after they salted something they specifically mentioned how good this salt tasted. It's not all kosher salts, though, because I tried Morton's kosher salt after this ran out and it had a horrible chemical aftertaste, and the flakes weren't as light and thin as these.<br /><br />If you don't know, kosher salt is make by evaporating water, so it's supposed to be a more natural and unprocessed kind of salt. Maybe Morton uses some other additives or something. The flakes of this salt are very light and there is no chemical aftertaste, just a very flavorful clean salt. Chefs also like this salt because the wide flakes make more contact area with meats and other foods which enhances the effect and draws out moisture faster (which is helpful in a good sear). Since the flakes are so light, this salt is even useful when it's not dissolved into the food all the way. The denser table salt is overwhelmingly salty if a patch of it hits your tongue. But the light fluffy flakes of this salt just taste like a burst of flavor. I think that's why it's the only salt where guests actually comment on the salt specifically, they probably had a pleasant surprise getting one whole flake melting on their tongue.<br /><br />My local Whole Foods stopped selling this brand so I was elated to find this salt on Amazon and hope they continue to sell it!"

Store refrigerated.<br /><br />Optional: To make it pretty, melt a cup of white chocolate with a tablespoon of shortening at 70% in the microwave for 1 minute. Dip a fork in the white chocolate and let it drizzle from the fork onto the semi-sweet chocolate covered cookies. If done neatly, your cookies will look beautiful.<br /><br />Hint: I do one batch in semi-sweet chocolate and one batch in white chocolate. Then, I drizzle the cookies with the alternate chocolate.

Saw it at Costco about a year ago and bought a box to try it out; I bought it primarily because it had high fiber and high percentages of vitamins and minerals. The taste is fabulous...slightly sweet with a cinnamon finish. It also doesn't get soggy too quickly. Every day right after I arrive at work I plow through three or four bowls along with a handful of nuts and fresh berries. And man does this stuff make you regular! Within minutes after finishing my last bowl I almost always have a Code Blue situation necessitating a sprint down the hallway to the bathroom to lay some massive cable! Buy it man!!

This multi-grain chips may be packed with goodness, but they taste like a stale wheat thin that was left sitting in a bag of real tortilla chips for awhile and managed to pick up a bit of their flavor.  I think I would actually like these better if they were simple multi-grain crackers without the thin brushing of flavoring.<br /><br />Someone looking for a healthy alternative might be happy with these.  If you are a compulsive snacker, then maybe you could get used to the taste.  But anyone looking to chow down on some tortilla chips isn't going to be too happy, and would have to force themselves through a bag of these rather than eating what they really wanted.<br /><br />Unless you covered them with cheese and made nachos.

These products are definitely not inexpensive, so I was excited to try the Clear Scalp & Hair Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil.  I have to say that while this is not expensive, it also isn't as good as what I've been using.  I have very thin hair and not much of it, so I try to use products that will not only take care of my hair and scalp, but also that will ""plump"" or at least give the appearance of thickness.  Good job on my first requirement, not so good on my second.  I have used the Clear Scalp & Hair Shampoo and like it, but because I found it a bit drying, I thought using the Clear Scalp & Hair Oil after the shampoo might be a good combination.  I am happy with the way the this product nourishes my hair after shampooing, but it feels a lot ""greasier"" than anything else I've tried.  I like the buttery coconut scent and my hair looked shiny after using this treatment, but it really felt like my sparse amount of hair was being ""weighed down,"" which turned out to be the opposite of plumping it up.  Using the Clear Scalp & Hair Oil on my hair when it is dry is a disaster.  Even a small amount plastered my hair down to my scalp which was not in any way attractive.  I want healthy hair, but I also want my hair to look as good as possible.<br />  I would recommend the Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy Ultra Shea Oil as a ""treatment"" only, not as a leave-in product.  I will use the product on a day on which I'm not leaving the house, and don't care how my hair looks.  Then I can wash my hair the next day to lose the heaviness and greasy feel.  Perhaps this product would work better on thick or curly hair, but if you have thinning or fine hair, this is probably not a product you want to use on a regular basis."

Vitamin E slows or prevents oil it is mixed with from going rancid. This is good, but do it happen in you?<br /><br />U kno, not all ""oxidation"" can or should be prevented. Digestion is oxidation, and so is pickling, and cooking, and aging (wine, cheese, us, etc). Oxidation is necessary, so blanket awe for Auntie Oxidant is unfounded. You wonder if raw coco is worth the premium price--twice, thrice, or quad what regular (roasted) organic Fair Trade coco products cost. It is definitely worth it if you can rev up your proneness  to enjoy the ""placebo effect"".  I dont say that cynically. A benefit is a benefit.<br /><br />THis product is milder than regular roasted coco nibs, but the mouthfeel is different than chocolit or roasted nibs--very fibrous. It isnt, however, celery, and breaks down in the mouth without much brux.

The container looks something like an old-style stick of deordorant with a plastic ball under the cap that LOOKS like it would roll around, but is actually stationary.  You squeeze the bottle until the gravy-like liquid treat starts to ooze out AROUND the ball and the dog licks it off. If you're not careful (i.e., if you squeeze too hard, esp. if you are treating a small dog like mine), you could end up with a mess on the floor.  That said, it is not difficult to master how hard to squeeze to treat the dog...just be forewarned to squeeze gently until you find the right pressure to use.<br /><br />As you will see in the accompanying video, my dog adores the flavor (I was using the liver flavor Lickety Split in the video).  She whines for it sometimes several times a day (she knows where I keep it).  However, she has a sensitive stomach and I have had to switch over to predominantly allergy-formula food and treats to reduce (and almost eliminate) the frequency of her spit-ups.  The day after I gave her the first taste of Lickety Stik, she spit up for the first time in a few months.  Perhaps that had nothing to do with it and it was something else, but it did make me wary of treating her with this product too often.<br /><br />Note that the packaging says this product is ""All-Natural with Vitamins,"" that there is only ""1 calorie in every 10 licks"" and that there are ""over 500 licks per bottle.""  The product is made in the USA.<br /><br />I can see where this product would be an excellent one to use for training purposes or on car trips, when you don't want to have to carry a lot of treats with you.<br /><br />Edited 10/11/11 to add that, after reviewing a couple of other reviews, it appears that the rollerball is SUPPOSED to roll, which was my assumption, but it did not on either of the ones I have used (bacon and liver flavors).  I just opened them up and tried to forcibly roll the ball.  I was able to on one but not the other.  Perhaps it varies by container or perhaps it takes a good while of use before the ball starts rolling.  I've been using it about a week."

So much in fact that it destroyed the taste of pistacio completely and I was left with a taste closer to salt and rancid peanuts, there are other brands without the added mixers, perhaps I got a bad batch of paste but there was no pistacio flavor in the paste I recieved at all; which has not been the case with other pastes i've tried- nor did this happen when i've made my own paste without salt and peanut oil as a mixer. Your experience may vary, but there are unsalted pastes available, that do not use peanut oil to excess as a mixer."

They all loved this food, especially my outdoors cat.  Unfortunately, my dog liked it even more, and it became a bit of a problem keeping him away while they were eating, and it normally is not a problem.  He is a very picky dog who loves fish, so I could tell by his reaction that the seafood taste was definitely good.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the can, I could see that this food includes real flake tuna - it is not very much different in appearance than Starkist tuna in the can for people.  It does not have that terrible smell that some wet catfoods do, (Like the Meow Mix Wholesome Goodness).  That is nice, because with some catfoods if you open the can and some flys on you, you have to go shower or smell like a fishmarket.  This food is not stinky like that.  It has a good enough smell to excite the cats, but the human noses here did not smell it in our trash or from across the room.<br /><br />I watched my cats closely, and my dog as well, since he got 'into it' and it treated their digestive systems well. Sometimes new food will make them sick, but this food did not in the least.<br />I am only giving this a 4 star because my cats did not finish the red snapper flavor either time I put it down for them.  They ate maybe 1/2 of it.  I don't think they liked that particular flavor as well as the others.  They ALL liked the yellowfin tuna the best."

The bergamot flavor is strong, not subtle, and a bit overwhelming---it's all you can taste.<br /><br />The ingredients of this tea are premium black teas with pure oil of bergamot---that's all.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes: ""Oil of bergamot comes from the rind of a citrus fruit which grows very well in the Calabria region of Italy. Pure top quality oil of bergamot is expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing.<br />Certain Earl Grey fanatics have grown especially fond of the top grade Calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have asked for more, ..More,... MORE! Thus was born Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey. In our Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, the black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the oil of bergamot takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it.""<br /><br />I must not be adventurous enough. I do agree with the manufacturer, though, and it might be the tea for you if you're a huge fan of bergamot and want a lot of it, and I also agree that it tastes pure, not soapy or bitter at all.<br />****"

I am a regular user of coconut oil but had never tried it mixed with sugar cane free, vegan cacao. It's definitely healthy. Taste-wise, it's a LOT less sweet than <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BTBR1Q"">Nutella Hazelnut Chocolate Spread 13 Oz.</a> - which I sadly love! - so this will take some getting used to. But, in trying to cut back on processed foods and refined sugar, this is a good trade off. Just like regular coconut oil, this treat stays in solid form in cooler temperatures (under 70F/21C) and will melt at higher temps, even turning liquid when it's warm (above 80F/26C). In its solid form, it breaks up like chocolate shavings; in its softer form, it has the consistency of Nutella or smooth peanut butter. It can be enjoyed on bread or salt-free crackers - or eaten alone, straight out of the jar - for a mildly sweet treat. However, be prepared that this product is not that sweet; it has more of an earthy, cacao flavor and the coconut flavor is not as strong as in plain coconut oil. Otherwise, it's a healthy way to add the benefits of organic coconut oil and the sweetness that comes from nature (cacao) to one's diet.<br /><br />**Note: Be be mindful that some may experience a mild-to-moderate allergic reaction (i.e., itching, hives, headache, throat swelling etc.) to this product, most likely in response to the cacao. Unfortunately, I was one of those people - I found out the hard way - but Amazon's excellent customer service was very helpful in issuing me a refund. Too bad, as I otherwise liked this product."

They come in four flavors and you get five of each flavor in this variety box.  Blueberry is my favorite, followed by strawberry (I like berry flavors).  Cranberry comes in third, but I still really like it, just not as much as blueberry and strawberry.  Though cranberries are pretty tart, the cranberry bar is not noticeably tarter than the others.  My least favorite is the tropical but only because it has a less distinct taste than the others.<br /><br />The name comes from the ingredients.  The bars have a trio of trios:  3 nuts, 3 seeds and 3 fruits.  The nuts, seeds and 2 of the fruits are the same in all the flavors.  The nuts are cashews, almonds & pistachios.  The seeds are sesame, pumpkin, & sunflower.  The two fruits that are in all the flavors are dates and raisins, but you don't really see or taste them so I wonder if they are cooked down into the ""glue"" that holds all the other ingredients together.  The third fruit in each flavor is (obviously) dried fruit in the named flavor, though the tropical is a blend of three different tropical fruits, none of which dominates.  The only other ingredients are rice malt, natural flavors, cane juice and sea salt.<br /><br />These are great bars for anyone who has issues with wheat or dairy.  The label says they are wheat free, gluten free, dairy free and kosher.  They also have no preservatives.  If you have peanut allergies, the label says they are packaged in a peanut free facility that processes other nuts.<br /><br />I'm not sure whether these bars are 1.2 ounces like the boxes of 24 all of one flavor or if they are 1.7 ounces like the bars in the variety boxes I've bought from another vendor.  I'm guessing these are the 1.7 ounces but will put the nutritional numbers for the 1.2 ounces size in brackets.  Because of the nuts, they have 16 (12) grams of fat per bar, but I've been reading articles that say nuts are a great snack and the fat in nuts is ""good"" fat.  The label says there is 2.5 (1.5) grams of saturated fat which surprised me but I guess some of the fat in nuts must be saturated.  To round out the rest of the nutrition facts:  calories, 230 (170); total carbs, 20g (14g); dietary fiber, 3g (2g); sugars, 8g (6g); protein, 6g (5g); cholesterol, 0g (0g); trans fat, 0g (0g); and sodium, 60mg (45mg).<br /><br />I love the nuts and seeds and the bars don't have the mealy texture that a lot of energy/snack bars have.  They are low sodium but high in taste and they are really satisfying.  I used to get granola bars but these are so much better."

I have tried many versions, and while one would think that water is water, they really do taste differently.<br /><br />In terms of taste, I thought this water tasted good.  I chose to chill mine before drinking it, and found it to be very refreshing, without any chemical or metallic taste that I was able to detect.  It tasted, in short, like water.  I did not think the change in pH made it taste any differently, so that is a real positive for me.<br /><br />While I cannot speak to the accuracy of the claims of the benefits to this particular formula of water, I can say that if the water does indeed contain the additional electrolytes, this provides a good alternative to sugary high calorie sports drinks.<br /><br />Many reviewer commented that this is merely treated water from municipalities, as opposed to spring water, and therefore not worth the cost.  If this were the sole source of my water intake, I would agree.  I would not purchase this for the whole of my drinking and cooking water.  But when looking for a bottle of water to take on a trip or throw in a backpack, or a source of electrolytes after athletic activity (or illness) I think this would fit the bit quite nicely."

But it has many more benefits than that, like a rich, deep chocolate taste that lingers until the next bite is taken and a subtle but distinct caramel taste. My home-popped snack I eat by the handfuls but SnackWell's popcorn I eat one at a time to fully enjoy this taste treat.<br /><br />This treat was first made in 1992 but it took me nine years to discover it; maybe because they upped the calories from 100 to 130. How can you enjoy a 100-calorie snack? What's with that! And others must have agreed with me because sales for the 100-calorie version sunk from $490 million in 1995 to $32 million in 2010. The 130-calorie version has been introduced on the market with the advertising slogan, ""Be Bad, Snack Well.""

The price it's great too, the only weird thing is getting 12 packs at the time. I never use to buy grocery in a bulk!<br />The product is outstanding; I use a ratio of 2 and 1/2 amount of liquid (I use 2/3 water and 1/3 milk) to 1 unit of oats, bring it to boil and then let it simmer for 15-20 minutes while I shower. It gets so creamy, you hardly need anything else...maybe just a tad of sugar!! Healthy and delicious way to start the day!!"

Specifically, the ""One Star"" reviews, to which I always go, to see if the faults these other reviewers find with any merchandise would prevent me from buying it.<br /><br />WOW!  They sure seemed to hate the KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE 9-OUNCE BAGS, (PACK OF 12), that I had bought as 1 ounce bags, liked A LOT, decided to subscribe....and then, for good measure, got 2 orders of the 9 ounce bags.<br /><br />Yes...I love potato chips....especially these KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE FLAVOUR....but others seemed to really HATE them...or at least, hate how they had changed.<br />But then I realized they were talking about OTHER FLAVOURS!  Amazon, in it's deep wisdom, has obviously seen fit to put ALL comments concerning ALL flavours of KETTLE, (and other brands of?????) potato chips, TOGETHER!<br /><br />Of course, this DOES have SOME advantages, because most potato-chip lovers, (like me!), enjoy eating several flavour, and brand varieties.  So, comparisons can be made easily.  Also, as we're all potato-chip lovers, but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing, we are, here a sort of ""United Nations of Potato Chip Lovers""....all different, but all united in our love of Potato Chips!  (The rest of the world can REALLY benefit from the example of our tightly-knit, but ever...er,...expanding...group here, I think! : )  But -- not at first realizing that these<br />different flavour reviews were all together, did cause me a little confusion and dismay.... at least to begin with.... (Amazon should have mentioned that this is the ""Kettle Potato Chip Review Forum""! : )<br /><br />I am happy to report that KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBEQUE FLAVOUR, are totally delicious!  (At least they are in the one-ounce bags...hopefully the same product in the 9 ounce bags will taste the same!)  These are definitely chips for ADULTS, however -- and/or children whose stronger-than-adult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips.  They are NOT the strongest flavour I have ever had...that was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even me!<br />These Backyard Barbeque chips by Kettle, however, have just the right amount of sweetness, (with honey powder, onion and sugar), to take the edge of the stonger flavours<br />(paprika, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, and natural smoke flavour), of which there is less, (they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners.)<br /><br />The complete list of ingredients of these KETTLE BACKYARD BARBECUE CHIPS, (in the 1-ounce bags, and hopefully, in the 9 ounce bags as well), is as follows:<br /><br />Potatoes<br />Vegetable Oil, (Safflower and Sunflower Oil),<br />Honey Powder, (Dried cane sugar, honey),<br />Rice Powder<br />Sugar<br />Salt<br />Onion Powder<br />Tomato Powder<br />Paprika<br />Torula Yeast<br />Garlic Powder<br />Chili Pepper<br />Citric Acid<br />Cayenne Pepper<br />Paprika Oleoresin, (Colour)<br />Natural Smoke Flavour<br /><br />Naturally cooked, natural ingredients.  The combination is a true taste treat!<br /><br />Of course, as with all ptato chips, moderation is the key.<br />Potatoes contain a LOT of potassium....which gives energy and othr good things....but too much of which can damage kindneys.  The vegetable oil is great -- but too much oil, (as well as too much starch, from the potatoes), can hurt the eyes.  Natural smoke flavour is SO yummy....but it, (as well as sugar), has -- in very large amounts -- been linked to cancer production<br /><br />As far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go, this<br />can be ameliorated, (a bit), by drinking TEA...which is good for the eyes.  But as far as the potassium, (energy - good, too much -- bad for the kidneys), and the sugar and natural smoke flavour, (too much leading to cancer production) -- the only thing is to do what is good in everything.....M O D E R A T I O N...!<br /><br />Twice or three times a month, I allow myself to go on what I call a ""Potato Chip Diet"".  I eat only one large bag, (or the equivalent in small ones), of potato chips all day.  I supplement this with tea, coffee, and lemonade, as well as several servings of Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials, (I like the Dark Chocolate flavour)  This adds up to fewer calories than I would normally eat, if I had my normal three meals a day plus snacks.  It also teaches me to eat s-l-o-w-l-y, because that one big bag, (or many little bags), never lasts as long as I'd like.  Anyway, with excercise and sensible eating, the rest of the month, (and keeping my scale nearby, and weighing myself at least twice a day, every day), I've taken off ten pounds in the last three months! : )<br /><br />These BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips from KETTLE,<br />are totally scrumptious.  Except for those jalapino chips, (which tasted good, but were far too spicy for my own taste buds), I have yet to meet a potato chip I didn't like to eat.  These Kettle BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips, with their combination of potatoes, sweetness, and spices, have truly become one of my top five favourites....if not the VERY first favourite, of all!<br /><br />Flavoured potato PERFECTION!"

This Weruva flavor, for example, has 85% water (only 15% dry ingredients).  Here is what the FDA says on its web site:<br /><br />""It is especially important to look at the moisture guarantee for canned foods, even when comparing a canned food with another canned. Under AAFCO regulations, the maximum percentage moisture content for a pet food is 78%, except for products labeled as a ""stew,"" ""in sauce,"" ""in gravy,"" or similar terms. The extra water gives the product the qualities needed to have the appropriate texture and fluidity. Some of these exempted products have been found to contain as much as 87.5% moisture. This doesn't sound like much difference until the dry matter contents are compared. For example, a product with a guarantee of 87.5% moisture contains 12.5% dry matter, only half as much as a product with a 75% moisture guarantee (25% dry matter).""<br /><br />On top of the nutrition problems, Weruva is ripping you off on a cost basis (this is my comment, not the FDA's). Looking at the dry ingredients, Weruba is charging you about $2 per ounce ($1.60 per 0.825 oz dry ingredients in a 5.5 oz can).  The top premium cat foods charge about $1 per ounce of dry ingredients.  Avoderm is 80 cents per 1 oz dry weight.  Science Diet is less than 70 cents per oz dry weight.  So Weruva is nearly 3 times the cost for ingredients other than water comparing Science Diet.<br /><br />So if you have a lot of money to waste and don't mind your cats having dry hair and other skin problems from lack of essential fats in the diet, then go for Weruva.  Otherwise, wait until they drop their price and increase the fat content."

So it seems that there may have been a mixup between the product and description, which may have been entirely unintentional and an accident. The product itself and description apparently have changed, apparently all for the better. So, I am changing my rating to a 5 star. I have to wonder if the color of the iodine-starch reaction produced is not merely based on 1) the amount of starch, but also 2) the ratio of iodine concentration to starch concentration to insure there is enough of each reagent to react, 3) the temperature, 4) the type of solvent, and 5) the type of iodine used. I did my test with a special low concentration organic iodine, Iodine Trichloride. That said, I'm glad that the seller has sorted this out and is now selling a product that matches its Amazon description. I hope everyone trys this product now, because it looks like a great deal for dried 100% Wasabi powder. Enjoy!"

388088,B0095KATS4,A2TS3ASYVLBGVR,Nick,21,21,5,1323561600,The flavours are not lies!,"These beans are a wonderful thing. The good flavors, you can eat, and they are totally fantastic. The terrible flavors, you can belittle the manhood of your friends with. The in-between flavors? Like grass? They're largely there to confuse you, and do so wonderfully.<br /><br />To sum up my experience with them, an anecdote:<br /><br />Driving along one summer, eating said beans, my two friends convince me to eat the Booger flavoured one. ""Okay,"" I begin ""but only if you get a good flavored one ready to get the taste out of my mouth.""<br /><br />My first friend passes me the booger-bean, and gets a grape-bean ready on deck. The booger bean was mostly flavourless... until the saliva hit my tongue! Retching, I spat out the window, and demanded the grape bean. Blargh! The dark colour tricked them! It was dirt! Spitting again, I demanded another bean. They produced another dark coloured one, this one seeming noticeably more purple in the light. Noooo! It was more dirt!<br /><br />Pulling over, and spitting out the bean, they presented me with a white one. ""Alright,"" they said ""This can only be popcorn, or marshmallow.""<br /><br />Seeing no bad option, I took the bean and chewed it gratefully. Then I vomited in my mouth.<br /><br />It was neither popcorn, nor marshmallow. It was rotten egg!<br /><br />Suffice to say, that these are not the kind of jelly bean you buy, thinking that every one of them will be wonderful. The rotten egg, dirt, soap, and vomit beans all taste exactly what they are supposed to. And that is what makes them a fantastic product."

I made a batch tonight, they are DELICIOUS.  I gave one to each of my family members (all Gluten-eating folks) and everybody loved them. Let me warn you. Licking the beaters tastes alot like licking a dirty chalk-board. But the end result is moist, fluffy and perfectly chocolatey. Topped with Betty Crocker Chocolate Fudge icing, these were a real treat. I'm not even sure that I could tell the difference between this and the real thing if I tried."

I have been making homemake pizza for 20+ years now and always used bread or high-gluten flour. (Mostly King Arthur).<br /><br />In the past I have read about using Italian ""00"" flour but have not tried it. King Arthur offers ""00"" flour but I always thought the protien content was tool low, looked more like cake flour then something I would want to use for pizza.<br /><br />Surfing the other day I came across this flour and read about how much people loved it for making pizza. Seeing that it had a higher protien content (11% compared to KA's 8.5%) I though I would give it a try.<br /><br />Well based on last nights results I'm a fan and may never go back to HG flour again for pizza.<br /><br />The dough was very easy to work with (you will not be tossing this dough) very soft and easy to work with.<br /><br />I used the following bakers percentages:<br /><br />Italian ""00"" flour 100.00% (1 lb 4 oz approx 4.5 cups)<br />Water  57.00% (11.4 oz - approx 1.333 cups)<br />IDY  0.17%  (.03 oz - approx .333 tsp)<br />Salt, Fine  3.00%  (.6 oz - approx 1 tbsp)<br /><br />I use two 16 Oz balls for two 14"" pizza"

After reading the study for myself, I believe it is inaccurate to say the levels are too high.  The dairy formula tested below levels allowed in drinking water. The goal is reduction becasue elimination is unrealistic.  I have been mixing with some Earth's Best and may increase to a 50/50 mix until Nature's One releases more details on their testing and how they are going to adress this issue going forward.  Overall though, I still think this is the best formula on the market and I want to see Nature's One improve with this crisis, not be forced out of business.  I have bigger concerns about other formulas (organic and non organic) that have nothing to do with hexane.  To be fair, we prepare her bottles with filtered water so there is not much arsenic in that water. Our baby was breastfed for 7 months (we started supplementing the formula at 6 months) and she will continue to get about 20% of her milk as forzen breastmilk until she is 10 months old."
