I like it with yogurt, pancakes, fruit, lemonade, in cooking, and even by the shot. However, after reading about maple country and maple syrup culture, I toyed with the romantic idea of buying directly from maple syrup makers. I recently was able to do that. I ordered a gallon of maple syrup grade B from Bear Mountain Vermont Maple (that's the place I chose after some research). Their sugar bush is in a remote mountain that borders Quebec and has never been farmed. Although the syrup is not certified organic, no pesticides or insecticides are used anywhere in the area. These are really nice, honest people and it was a great experience ordering from them. The syrup is great. And the price is good too: 1 gallon is $60 (including shipping) and is shipped in two half-gallon BPA-free containers that have an oxygen barrier coating on the outside to help the syrup stay fresh longer. The service was fast too. I got the shipment just 4 days after I placed my order (I live in Northern California). So yes, I'm really satisfied. I am not ready to say that I prefer this syrup to Coombs Family Farms'. They're both really good in my opinion.

It was filled with bags of fancy nut mixes by Sahale Snacks.  I had been trying to wean myself off sweets by substituting nuts and other trail mixes for candy whenever I got the munchies.  Sahale snack mixes looked like the fancy, upscale \"town mouse\" to my regular, boring \"country mouse\" trail mixes.<br /><br />The one that caught my eye was Sing Buri with cashew, pineapple, peanut, lemongrass and Chinese chili. The ingredients definitely made my mouth water, but the picture on the front is what sold me: a heaping bowl of delicious sweet and savory looking cashews and dried pineapple. The bag was pretty expensive at $5.99 on sale for 5 ounces, but I was definitely hooked at that point and decided to give it a try. I didn\\'t even wait to get home, but opened up the bag in the car and started snacking right away. It was amazing!<br /><br />The more I looked into Sahale Snacks, the more I liked. On the website, the story is told of the two founders hiking up Mt. Rainier in Washington State, dreaming of something beyond the regular peanut/raisin/m&m combo that was their trail mix. What resulted was a snack mix that was indulgent and healthy.<br /><br />These snack blends are a little pricy, but in my opinion, totally worth it. This would be a wonderful nut mix to offer to friends and guests when entertaining. This is a high brow snack that you or your guests will love.',\n",

Cats like what they like, and my cats have slightly more expensive taste -- again, except for Fred, who has quite an indiscriminate attitude towards food.<br /><br />I spoke with the vet about possibly switching Fred from his prescription diet to ProPlan and they reassured me that this was a very good food for cats with urinary tract problems, too.  Fred is the least picky cat I know when it comes to food, so I would only switch if cost because an issue.

So I just tried some mixed in with some ground beef the way I would use those two, a little goes a long way.  Worked great, the flavor mixed well and added a nice background flavor to the beef.

       "       'Andrew Knowlton, restaurant editor at <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005NIND\">Bon App&eacute;tit</a> magazine, predicts sriracha will be one of the biggest food trends of 2010!<br /><br />Knowlton was a guest on the CBS Early Show and shared, \"If you walk into any chef\\'s kitchen or home, you will find sriarcha. Sriracha is a hot sauce with flavor -- it livens up every dish you put it on.\"<br /><br />There are many sellers offering sriracha on Amazon.com. I recommend you compare the shipping charges of each. You can save by buying in quantity (and sharing with friends and relatives). Many supermarket chains are now carrying sriracha for $5 or less per bottle, again depending on the size.<br /><br />Once only found on Thai or Vietnamese restaurant tables, a bottle of Sriracha (sree-RAH-cha) Hot Chili Sauce is now a telltale sign of a great eatery, whether it is on a sidewalk hot dog stand, a family hamburger joint or my favorite Asian restaurant.<br /><br />Last year, New York Journal News reporter Kara Newman provided some background about the condiment nicknamed \"Thai ketchup.\" Here\\'s an excerpt:<br /><br />[[The two most commonly-found brands are Huy Fong, which sports a white rooster on the label, and Shark. (Supposedly, the shark is in homage to the shark-infested waters off the coast of Sriracha). Shark brand is made in Thailand and is used widely there as well as imported to U.S. stores and restaurants. Huy Fong is made in California by a Vietnamese immigrant, David Tran, and is the U.S. favorite.]]<br /><br />Sriracha is made of sun ripened chilies that are ground into a smooth paste with garlic. The sauce is nearly as thick as ketchup, which makes the squeeze bottle a handy way to deliver a spicy kick to your favorite foods. Speaking of ketchup, a little sriracha can add a nice kick to ketchup or your favorite dipping sauce without overpowering the other ingredients.<br /><br />Newman\\'s story featured recipes were adapted from Greg Gilbert, Jackson & Wheeler.<br /><br />Sriracha Remoulade<br /><br />1 cup mayonnaise<br />1/4 cup sriracha<br />2 tablespoons red wine vinegar<br /><br />Whisk together until smooth. Serve as a dipping sauce with fried calamari rings.<br /><br />Fried Calamari<br /><br />1/2 cup calamari<br />1 cup milk<br />1 cup flour<br />1/2 cup semolina<br />Vegetable oil for frying<br />Salt and pepper<br /><br />Soak calamari rings in milk for about 20 minutes; drain.<br /><br />In a bowl, combine the flour and semolina. Dredge the calamari in the flour mixture, and shake off the excess. Heat the oil to 350 degrees, and fry the calamari until golden brown. Season with salt and pepper and serve with Sriracha Remoulade.<br /><br />Sriracha Spicy Buffalo Wings<br /><br />6 chicken wings<br />Oil for frying<br />3 tablespoons Frank\\'s Red Hot Sauce<br />1 tablespoons sriracha<br />1 tablespoons butter, softened<br />Baby mache or other lettuce to garnish<br /><br />Fry the chicken wings until crispy. In a bowl, combine the red-hot sauce, sriracha, and butter. Toss the wings in the sauce and serve. Garnish with baby mache or other lettuce.<br /><br />In summary, I grew up with pepper, salt and Tabasco pepper sauce on the table for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Did sriracha replace my bottle of Tabasco? Yes. Sriracha is hotter but with a light, sweet finish that sets it apart from the vinegar tang of other pepper sauces.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars',\n",

       "       'I\\'ve tried a few varieties of Bagel chips, and by far, this is my favorite.  Most bagel chips use mini-bagels, cut horizontally.  You can tell because of the hole in the center.  Bagels are typically seasoned on the outside, sliced, then baked as chips.  If you get a chip that is close to the exterior of the bagel chances are good that you will get the seasoning (usually too much).  If you get an interior chip you will likely get too little seasoning (if any).  Some brands season the chips after they are cooked as well, which almost guarantees that you\\'ll get far too much seasoning.<br /><br />Stacy\\'s starts with regular, whole bagels; the same high-quality bagels that you will find on a supermarket or baker\\'s sehlf.  Because these are sliced vertically, you get round chips that are all seasoned correctly on the outside ring.  Each chip is round and perfect for dipping or spreading.  I love regular bagels toasted with cream cheese, which is also good with Stacy\\'s bagel chips.  However, these are good enough to warrant more creativity.  Try them with hummus, salsa, melted cheese--use your imagination.<br /><br />Yes, this is the same Stacy\\'s that makes <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KGW2BY\">Stacy\\'s Pita Chips</a>.  All of Stacy\\'s products are very high quality.  If you are a fan of everything bagels, you will love these.  The <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QZ2AZ0\">Simply Naked Bagel Chips</a> are similar to the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KGW2BY\">Simply Naked Pita Chips</a>--simple, and delicious with dip.

Nothing else like it that I\\'ve ever tasted.<br /><br />Now, the criticism. There is just too much sugar in the mix. The recommended proportion of mix to 8 oz milk is four tablespoons. (By the by, there is no powdered milk in here. You must add your own milk--or soymilk or rice milk--great option for lactose-intolerant types.)<br /><br />People, you are using a quarter cup of mix at 4 Tbs and most of the mix seems to be granulated sugar, which you can taste and crunch in your mouth if you sample the dry mix. Cutting down fifty percent on the mix gave me an acceptable cup of cocoa but...it was no longer double chocolate and it had naturally a poorer mouth feel and aroma.<br /><br />Double Chocolate Mix is some of the best cocoa I WOULD have had, if Ghirardelli could see their way to making a lower sugar version, and please, no sugar substitute, which I don\\'t like to use.<br /><br />Summary; great chocolate flavor, unsurpassed.

I\\'ve tried other products for dogs containing glucosamine, but wasn\\'t very happy about the animal products in them, because I know too much about where those animal products come from and how they\\'re processed, and prefer not to feed them to my dog. (One reviewer of this product, wishing for a chicken or beef flavor, asked, \"What kind of dog eats salmon?\" The answer: mine, every day.  He loves it,and for twelve years old he\\'s pretty darn healthy.)<br /><br />Unlike some of the dogs mentioned in other reviews, my dog loves the flavor of this.  The ingredients are exceptionally well thought out--they\\'re not fillers.  For example, ginger and turmeric are known to have anti-inflammatory properties, but dogs may not particularly like them in their raw form. Omega-3 fatty acids are also effective.<br /><br />Does it help?  After two weeks, I\\'d say maybe; since my dog doesn\\'t have a major problem, any change wouldn\\'t likely be dramatic, but he doesn\\'t seem quite so creaky.<br /><br />For a larger dog, the product, while reasonably priced considering the ingredients, can get a little pricey if you expect to use it consistently, and I believe with this type of supplement that\\'s what you\\'ll have to do if you want to get results and keep them. This 150-gram size will only last a few weeks. But I haven\\'t found a better product of this type.',\n",

After four brews with the Davidson\\'s, I\\'m very dissatisfied.<br /><br />First off, the color of the gunpowder pellets are no different between samples, but the Davidson\\'s uses bigger pellets, meaning bigger, older fan leaves.  The Temple of Heaven (ToH) gunpowder green uses smaller leaves, so when you brew there appear to be many more leaves because there are.  The Davidson\\'s often has several leaves and their attached stem rolled up into a single pellet.  The Davidson\\'s also has significantly more dirt, dust, and loose stems in the package.  In fact, it looks like I got the bottom of the barrel.<br /><br />****  Your Quality Control Is Terrible, Davidson!  ****<br /><br />The idea that it is organic should have some impact on the flavor, but the Davidson\\'s is more bitter, and the tea is orange/yellow after 3 minutes of brewing in RO filtered water heated to 170-180F in a French press.  The ToH tea is a greenish yellow, and has a better flavor with less bitterness.<br /><br />Overall, I am very unhappy with my Davidson\\'s purchase.  The ToH gunpowder green is better quality for less than half the price!!!<br /><br />When compared to the other gunpowder green tea options available, Davidson\\'s Gunpowder Green Tea is a 2 star gunpowder green tea for flavor that loses a star for poor pricing and very poor quality control.',\n",

It is mild in the lemon flavor and to use dessert analogy, it's more like drinking a lemon pound cake versus a lemon tart.<br /><br />Loose-leaf teas are usually superior to the crushed tea leaves in regular tea bags, but I often am impatient to deal with all the mess.  These are packed with loose-leaf tea in a mesh pyramid which allows for the benefits of the loose tea without having to clean out a teapot with the soggy leaves.  Each pyramid contains enough tea leaves for a small teapot, not just a single cup and are individually sealed for freshness.<br /><br />If you enjoy lemon chamomile tea, be sure to give this one a try.

       "       'Melitta Caf&eacute; Collection Gourmet Coffee: Hazelnut Cr&egrave;me Brulee<br /><br />First of all, a summary, for those of you who only want the brass tacks: using a high-quality drip coffee maker, the result was a pleasurable but not perfect experience, and so I give this coffee four out of five stars. If you are willing to add good cream to your coffee, then I would even venture to give this blend a full five-of-five rating.<br /><br />Before I even opened the package, I was hit by the smell of its contents, the strong scents wafting through every tiny opening. The smell, however, was of cinnamon rolls, not of coffee. Cautiously cutting open the container, I put it to my nose and was rewarded slightly by the previously noted sugary odor mixed with a very gentle smell of ground coffee beans (the package didn\\'t indicate the date of their grinding, but, having received them for review, I assumed they were relatively fresh.)<br /><br />I have to admit that I was a bit concerned about using the drip coffee makers because of the fineness of the grind, but nonetheless I approached them hoping for the best.<br /><br />One of the first things that struck my attention was the fact that the instructions on the side of the bag indicated a measure of two teaspoons of coffee per six ounces of water. The standard measurement for gourmet coffee is two tablespoons per six ounces. (Although two tablespoons per six ounces provides too strong a flavor for many people, it pulls out the best taste with the least amount of bitterness. Extra water should be added AFTER it has been brewed to lighten the coffee to the desired level. NEVER decrease the amount of coffee to make it less strong!)<br /><br />To properly determine the appeal of the coffee to the typical buyer, I decided to prepare the beans two ways:  (a) via a high-quality drip coffee maker using the \"two tablespoons of coffee grinds per cup of water\" measurement, and (b) via a more standard generic  drip appliance, using its recommended \"two teaspoons of coffee grinds per cup of water\" measurement.  I first tasted the results straight (without any added flavoring), and then with cream.<br /><br />Using the high-quality drip coffee maker, the results were quite satisfactory. The taste of smoky wood was definitely there, and the flavor brought to mind fire-roasted beans, slightly burnt to enhance their essence. The hazelnut flavoring was more of a scent than a taste, lingering on the tongue and in the nostrils after the rest has been swallowed.<br /><br />Good coffee prepared correctly should never be bitter. Never. So I was disappointed to find that there was, indeed, a small amount of bitter aftertaste in the cup I drank.<br /><br />Also to my disappointment was a bit of a sourness that permeated the entire experience, like the beans had been left to ripen a bit too long.<br /><br />To my surprise, one sensation that was not there was the sugar and cinnamon that hit me so hard when I initially opened the bag. I can only assume those flavors were run across the beans to provide a pre-brew experience to tantalize the potential buyer, but they didn\\'t make it across after the water had been applied.<br /><br />So, as stated at the beginning of my review, using a high-quality drip appliance the result was a pleasurable but not perfect experience, and a good start for my tasting process.<br /><br />With the initial \"pure\" tasting complete, I added some cream to my coffee. The result was wonderful. All of the bad tastes were washed away instantly. No more sourness or bitterness. Granted, a coffee drinker should not have to rely on something external to wash away unpleasant side flavors, but in this situation it produced a cup I eagerly look forward to drinking again. Five out of five stars for that experience.<br /><br />Next, I turned to the \"department-store\" brand of coffee maker and used eight tablespoons (the equivalent of 24 teaspoons) with 12 cups of water. The result was passable. It retained most of the flavors of the stronger brewing but in a watered-down state. Unfortunately, the bitterness and sourness - the two worst flavors - came out in full force. Judging purely by this taste test, I would give the coffee at most three stars.<br /><br />Next I added cream and, to my pleasant surprise, it again completely wiped away all of the unpleasant flavors, leaving behind a delightfully light cup that flowed smoothly down my throat. Once more, five out of five stars.<br /><br />I should note that I gave the lighter version (with cream) to a friend who generally does not enjoy coffee, and she loved it, going so far as to say it was one of the best cups of coffee she had had in years.<br /><br />I generally don\\'t like flavored coffees, but this one won me over as a good attempt and something I\\'m happy to keep on my shelf. Again I wish to note that I am disappointed that the addition of cream was a necessity in removing the very noticeable bad tastes from this blend, but at least they could be removed, which is more than I can say for many coffees out there.<br /><br />\"Black as the devil, hot as hell, pure as an angel, sweet as love.\"<br />-- Charles Maurice de Talleyrand (1754-1838) speaking of the perfect cup of coffee.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brianna<br /><br />Footnote from Grey: I agree with Brianna\\'s review. This coffee is much improved with the addition of cream. However, I got a very noticable hazlenut flavor from the coffee.',\n",

I have a Pomapoo (1/2 Pomeranian, 1/2 Poodle who is 10 months old) and he has been in pain for weeks because of this treat, and it broke my heart to know that I was the one keeping him in pain by feeding him these treats!! Maybe bigger dogs can digest them, but PLEASE PLEASE do not feed this product to your pet if you have a small dog! I thought it'd be a good alternative as he likes to chew and there is no rawhide in them, but the center does not break down, and he had one part lodged in his small intestine and another stuck in his stomach.

       "       'Homemade Dressings has developed a neat concept that allows you to make your own dressings at home and tweak the combinations until you find the one that works best for your taste.  There are presently three different flavors that blend dried herbs and spices,  to which you add oil and vinegar to make fresh dressing on demand.  The Napa Valley blend contains garlic, citric acid, tomato powder and, I believe I taste, oregano and thyme in there as well.  The total effect is similar to an Italian herb dressing.<br /><br />I was fascinated by the blend and experimented with several oil and vinegar combinations.  With the oils I tried canola, vegetable and extra virgin olive.  I teamed those oils variously with red wine, white wine, balsamic and cider vinegars.  In my opinion, the strong flavors of EVOO, red wine vinegar, and balsamic vinegar overwhelmed the spices.  My least favorite dressing base was the EVOO with red wine vinegar; the resulting dressing had an overwhelming olive oil taste, and the strong red wine vinegar seemed sharp and harsh with the herb/spice mix.  My favorite was the Napa Valley blend with cider vinegar and vegetable oil.  That combination seemed to best showcase the herbs and spices; just a nice smooth dressing.<br /><br />In addition to making the dressing, I tried using the blend on some boneless skinless chicken breasts.  One piece of chicken was put in a baggie with the Napa Valley prepared dressing for a few hours before grilling.  It turned out all right - what you would expect from an Italian dressing marinade.  However, using the mix straight from the jar as a dry rub seemed to give the chicken a much more intense flavor.  I just sprinkled it over the chicken and let it rest for 20 minutes before grilling.  The mix was also very nice tossed with some pasta and a drizzle of olive oil.<br /><br />Recommended.',\n",

       "       'I can tell from the reviews I\\'ve read that my opinion will differ from most.  My disappointment with this curry paste is that I found it considerably milder than what has become my standard <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SBB8M4\">Patak\\'s Vindaloo Curry Paste, Hot, 10-Ounce Glass Jars (Pack of 6)</a> which I would absolutely subscribe to if Amazon would ship it here.  Unfortunately for me, they will not :(  So given the general tenor of the reviews and opinion of obviously informed people, I ordered this.<br />Patak\\'s is sold at one health food store on this island (Ohau) and the price has quadrupled in the past 3 years, so I came to Amazon hoping I could get it here.  I can not, but likely you can (they ship to the 48 contiguous states but not Hawaii or Alaska).<br />I found this to be a passable substitute, but prefer Patak\\'s enough that I am willing to pay twice as much if need be.  I will note that this recommendation would only apply to those who like hot curry.  If you thought this was hot, stay away from patak\\'s ;)<br />My work around is to spice this up with patak\\'s pickles <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JSQDVS\">Pataks Mixed Pickle 10oz</a> (which I am positively addicted to).<br />I would recommend this for those who do not like hot curry, or who, like myself, are out of range of Amazon\\'s shipping for Patak\\'s.  If they start shipping that to Hawaii, I will switch over without a second thought.  I have it on subsciption now for when I am too tired to make paste, and am out of my preferred.  With only one small store carrying it here, that sometimes happens, so I am glad I can get this to have something on hand for those times.<br />I\\'ll note one other advantage; likely the one which allows amazon to ship here; is that Kitchens of India pastes are packed in foil pouches, so they take up less room in your cabinets.  The premeasured amount is both a positive and a negative.  like with anything else packed in singled-serve it costs a bit more than a jar (for example).  It also does not allow you to easily adjust for your own taste preferences.  I suspect that I\\'d like it better if I doubled the recommended amount, but that\\'s all I can do; 1 or 2, or... I can not put in a 2 tablespoons vs .5 for example.  For me, this is a serious draw back.<br />In brief, it is a convenient product, makes a nice dinner very quickly, but i find it on the weak side and would switch brands of curry paste if I could get the other here.',\n",

The Starbucks mocha Frapachinos (bottled) are usually the only coffee-esque drink that I like, and even those I only drink a few times a year. The illy issimo Cappuccino wasn\\'t bad - it wasn\\'t nearly as creamy as the Starbucks drinks, but it was also around a half of the calories, so there\\'s a bit of give and take there. It\\'s also not super sweet - many of the Starbucks drinks border on that thin line between really tasty and \"The sugar is melting my teeth\". The illy issimo is very safely stashed on the not-super-sweet side of the fence. Don\\'t take that to mean there isn\\'t any sweetness - I\\'d compare it to a Symphony chocolate bar versus a Hershey\\'s milk chocolate bar. They both have very similar flavor profiles, but the generic Hershey bar is so much sweeter. I can\\'t really say it\\'s like a dark chocolate either, because the cappuccino didn\\'t have a lot of the bitter undertones that the dark chocolates and espresso drinks tend to have.<br /><br />As for energy burst, I should preface by saying that I\\'m not much of a caffeine drinker any more. My normal drink is straight water, and at restaurants iced tea (unsweet). I think my body has stored up reserves of caffeine and sugar from my childhood days though - back when I drank a six-pack (or more) of Coke a day. That being said, the \"rush\" from the drink took a few hours for me to feel it (granted I had already eaten lunch and had a full stomach, which might explain the lag).

But this salt is really different than any others I've had. I don't know if it is the process of making kosher salt, or the raw source ingredients, or the shape of the flakes, but every other salt I've had pales in comparison. I even thought it might be just my imagination, but I've had people come over and after they salted something they specifically mentioned how good this salt tasted. It's not all kosher salts, though, because I tried Morton's kosher salt after this ran out and it had a horrible chemical aftertaste, and the flakes weren't as light and thin as these.<br /><br />If you don't know, kosher salt is make by evaporating water, so it's supposed to be a more natural and unprocessed kind of salt. Maybe Morton uses some other additives or something. The flakes of this salt are very light and there is no chemical aftertaste, just a very flavorful clean salt. Chefs also like this salt because the wide flakes make more contact area with meats and other foods which enhances the effect and draws out moisture faster (which is helpful in a good sear). Since the flakes are so light, this salt is even useful when it's not dissolved into the food all the way. The denser table salt is overwhelmingly salty if a patch of it hits your tongue. But the light fluffy flakes of this salt just taste like a burst of flavor. I think that's why it's the only salt where guests actually comment on the salt specifically, they probably had a pleasant surprise getting one whole flake melting on their tongue.<br /><br />My local Whole Foods stopped selling this brand so I was elated to find this salt on Amazon and hope they continue to sell it!\",\n",

       "       'Raw coco powders and nibs touted to be the hyest in anti-oxidant compounds of all plants have yet to be proven beneficial. Please keep in mind a few lab experiments showing that antioxidants slow or prevent stuff physically near them from combining with, you guessed it, oxygen, dont prove anything good happens in a human body from the same chemical activity. Vitamin E slows or prevents oil it is mixed with from going rancid. This is good, but do it happen in you?<br /><br />U kno, not all \"oxidation\" can or should be prevented. Digestion is oxidation, and so is pickling, and cooking, and aging (wine, cheese, us, etc). Oxidation is necessary, so blanket awe for Auntie Oxidant is unfounded. You wonder if raw coco is worth the premium price--twice, thrice, or quad what regular (roasted) organic Fair Trade coco products cost. It is definitely worth it if you can rev up your proneness  to enjoy the \"placebo effect\".  I dont say that cynically. A benefit is a benefit.<br /><br />THis product is milder than regular roasted coco nibs, but the mouthfeel is different than chocolit or roasted nibs--very fibrous. It isnt, however, celery, and breaks down in the mouth without much brux. My feeling at the moment is, go back to eating regular roasted coco products--nibs and powder, and take resveratrol or grape seed extract capsules to make up the diff in (presumedly) lost antioxis. Five stars, not for what the product is--but for what I hope it is.',\n",

       "       '<span class=\"tiny\"> Length:: 1:01 Mins<br /><br /></span>Lickety Stik is a lickable (vs. edible) dog treat that comes in a variety of flavors, such as bacon, liver and chicken.  The container looks something like an old-style stick of deordorant with a plastic ball under the cap that LOOKS like it would roll around, but is actually stationary.  You squeeze the bottle until the gravy-like liquid treat starts to ooze out AROUND the ball and the dog licks it off. If you\\'re not careful (i.e., if you squeeze too hard, esp. if you are treating a small dog like mine), you could end up with a mess on the floor.  That said, it is not difficult to master how hard to squeeze to treat the dog...just be forewarned to squeeze gently until you find the right pressure to use.<br /><br />As you will see in the accompanying video, my dog adores the flavor (I was using the liver flavor Lickety Split in the video).  She whines for it sometimes several times a day (she knows where I keep it).  However, she has a sensitive stomach and I have had to switch over to predominantly allergy-formula food and treats to reduce (and almost eliminate) the frequency of her spit-ups.  The day after I gave her the first taste of Lickety Stik, she spit up for the first time in a few months.  Perhaps that had nothing to do with it and it was something else, but it did make me wary of treating her with this product too often.<br /><br />Note that the packaging says this product is \"All-Natural with Vitamins,\" that there is only \"1 calorie in every 10 licks\" and that there are \"over 500 licks per bottle.\"  The product is made in the USA.<br /><br />I can see where this product would be an excellent one to use for training purposes or on car trips, when you don\\'t want to have to carry a lot of treats with you.<br /><br />Edited 10/11/11 to add that, after reviewing a couple of other reviews, it appears that the rollerball is SUPPOSED to roll, which was my assumption, but it did not on either of the ones I have used (bacon and liver flavors).  I just opened them up and tried to forcibly roll the ball.  I was able to on one but not the other.  Perhaps it varies by container or perhaps it takes a good while of use before the ball starts rolling.  I\\'ve been using it about a week.',\n",

Unfortunately, my dog liked it even more, and it became a bit of a problem keeping him away while they were eating, and it normally is not a problem.  He is a very picky dog who loves fish, so I could tell by his reaction that the seafood taste was definitely good.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the can, I could see that this food includes real flake tuna - it is not very much different in appearance than Starkist tuna in the can for people.  It does not have that terrible smell that some wet catfoods do, (Like the Meow Mix Wholesome Goodness).  That is nice, because with some catfoods if you open the can and some flys on you, you have to go shower or smell like a fishmarket.  This food is not stinky like that.  It has a good enough smell to excite the cats, but the human noses here did not smell it in our trash or from across the room.<br /><br />I watched my cats closely, and my dog as well, since he got 'into it' and it treated their digestive systems well. Sometimes new food will make them sick, but this food did not in the least.<br />I am only giving this a 4 star because my cats did not finish the red snapper flavor either time I put it down for them.  They ate maybe 1/2 of it.  I don't think they liked that particular flavor as well as the others.  They ALL liked the yellowfin tuna the best.\",\n",

The bergamot flavor is strong, not subtle, and a bit overwhelming---it\\'s all you can taste.<br /><br />The ingredients of this tea are premium black teas with pure oil of bergamot---that\\'s all.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes: \"Oil of bergamot comes from the rind of a citrus fruit which grows very well in the Calabria region of Italy. Pure top quality oil of bergamot is expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing.<br />Certain Earl Grey fanatics have grown especially fond of the top grade Calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have asked for more, ..More,... MORE! Thus was born Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey. In our Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, the black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the oil of bergamot takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it.\"<br /><br />I must not be adventurous enough. I do agree with the manufacturer, though, and it might be the tea for you if you\\'re a huge fan of bergamot and want a lot of it, and I also agree that it tastes pure, not soapy or bitter at all.<br />****',\n",

But, in trying to cut back on processed foods and refined sugar, this is a good trade off. Just like regular coconut oil, this treat stays in solid form in cooler temperatures (under 70F/21C) and will melt at higher temps, even turning liquid when it\\'s warm (above 80F/26C). In its solid form, it breaks up like chocolate shavings; in its softer form, it has the consistency of Nutella or smooth peanut butter. It can be enjoyed on bread or salt-free crackers - or eaten alone, straight out of the jar - for a mildly sweet treat. However, be prepared that this product is not that sweet; it has more of an earthy, cacao flavor and the coconut flavor is not as strong as in plain coconut oil.

Blueberry is my favorite, followed by strawberry (I like berry flavors).  Cranberry comes in third, but I still really like it, just not as much as blueberry and strawberry.  Though cranberries are pretty tart, the cranberry bar is not noticeably tarter than the others.  My least favorite is the tropical but only because it has a less distinct taste than the others.<br /><br />The name comes from the ingredients.  The bars have a trio of trios:  3 nuts, 3 seeds and 3 fruits.  The nuts, seeds and 2 of the fruits are the same in all the flavors.  The nuts are cashews, almonds & pistachios.  The seeds are sesame, pumpkin, & sunflower.  The two fruits that are in all the flavors are dates and raisins, but you don\\'t really see or taste them so I wonder if they are cooked down into the \"glue\" that holds all the other ingredients together.  The third fruit in each flavor is (obviously) dried fruit in the named flavor, though the tropical is a blend of three different tropical fruits, none of which dominates.  The only other ingredients are rice malt, natural flavors, cane juice and sea salt.<br /><br />These are great bars for anyone who has issues with wheat or dairy.  The label says they are wheat free, gluten free, dairy free and kosher.  They also have no preservatives.  If you have peanut allergies, the label says they are packaged in a peanut free facility that processes other nuts.<br /><br />I\\'m not sure whether these bars are 1.2 ounces like the boxes of 24 all of one flavor or if they are 1.7 ounces like the bars in the variety boxes I\\'ve bought from another vendor.  I\\'m guessing these are the 1.7 ounces but will put the nutritional numbers for the 1.2 ounces size in brackets.  Because of the nuts, they have 16 (12) grams of fat per bar, but I\\'ve been reading articles that say nuts are a great snack and the fat in nuts is \"good\" fat.  The label says there is 2.5 (1.5) grams of saturated fat which surprised me but I guess some of the fat in nuts must be saturated.  To round out the rest of the nutrition facts:  calories, 230 (170); total carbs, 20g (14g); dietary fiber, 3g (2g); sugars, 8g (6g); protein, 6g (5g); cholesterol, 0g (0g); trans fat, 0g (0g); and sodium, 60mg (45mg).<br /><br />I love the nuts and seeds and the bars don\\'t have the mealy texture that a lot of energy/snack bars have.

Now I discovered a popcorn snack that definitely is for mature taste buds that appreciate the finer things in life.<br /><br />SnackWell\\'s Fudge Drizzled Caramel Popcorn by Nabisco is certainly not as greasy or as salty and has far fewer leftover kernels than my home-popped popcorn. But it has many more benefits than that, like a rich, deep chocolate taste that lingers until the next bite is taken and a subtle but distinct caramel taste. My home-popped snack I eat by the handfuls but SnackWell\\'s popcorn I eat one at a time to fully enjoy this taste treat.<br /><br />This treat was first made in 1992 but it took me nine years to discover it; maybe because they upped the calories from 100 to 130. How can you enjoy a 100-calorie snack? What\\'s with that! And others must have agreed with me because sales for the 100-calorie version sunk from $490 million in 1995 to $32 million in 2010. The 130-calorie version has been introduced on the market with the advertising slogan, \"Be Bad, Snack Well.\" Sounds good to me.<br /><br />SnackWell\\'s Fudge Drizzled Caramel Popcorn comes in a box of five 1.06 ounce individual bags. You might beconcerned about theamounts of sugar, salt and fat, but you can\\'t worry a whole lot about calories when engaged in snacking.<br /><br />Join the chorus, \"Be Bad, Snack Well.\"',\n",

Amazon, in it\\'s deep wisdom, has obviously seen fit to put ALL comments concerning ALL flavours of KETTLE, (and other brands of?????) potato chips, TOGETHER!<br /><br />Of course, this DOES have SOME advantages, because most potato-chip lovers, (like me!), enjoy eating several flavour, and brand varieties.  So, comparisons can be made easily.  Also, as we\\'re all potato-chip lovers, but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing, we are, here a sort of \"United Nations of Potato Chip Lovers\"....all different, but all united in our love of Potato Chips!  (The rest of the world can REALLY benefit from the example of our tightly-knit, but ever...er,...expanding...group here, I think! : )  But -- not at first realizing that these<br />different flavour reviews were all together, did cause me a little confusion and dismay.... at least to begin with.... (Amazon should have mentioned that this is the \"Kettle Potato Chip Review Forum\"! : )<br /><br />I am happy to report that KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBEQUE FLAVOUR, are totally delicious!  (At least they are in the one-ounce bags...hopefully the same product in the 9 ounce bags will taste the same!)  These are definitely chips for ADULTS, however -- and/or children whose stronger-than-adult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips.  They are NOT the strongest flavour I have ever had...that was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even me!<br />These Backyard Barbeque chips by Kettle, however, have just the right amount of sweetness, (with honey powder, onion and sugar), to take the edge of the stonger flavours<br />(paprika, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, and natural smoke flavour), of which there is less, (they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners.)<br /><br />The complete list of ingredients of these KETTLE BACKYARD BARBECUE CHIPS, (in the 1-ounce bags, and hopefully, in the 9 ounce bags as well), is as follows:<br /><br />Potatoes<br />Vegetable Oil, (Safflower and Sunflower Oil),<br />Honey Powder, (Dried cane sugar, honey),<br />Rice Powder<br />Sugar<br />Salt<br />Onion Powder<br />Tomato Powder<br />Paprika<br />Torula Yeast<br />Garlic Powder<br />Chili Pepper<br />Citric Acid<br />Cayenne Pepper<br />Paprika Oleoresin, (Colour)<br />Natural Smoke Flavour<br /><br />Naturally cooked, natural ingredients.  The combination is a true taste treat!<br /><br />Of course, as with all ptato chips, moderation is the key.<br />Potatoes contain a LOT of potassium....which gives energy and othr good things....but too much of which can damage kindneys.  The vegetable oil is great -- but too much oil, (as well as too much starch, from the potatoes), can hurt the eyes.  Natural smoke flavour is SO yummy....but it, (as well as sugar), has -- in very large amounts -- been linked to cancer production<br /><br />As far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go, this<br />can be ameliorated, (a bit), by drinking TEA...which is good for the eyes.  But as far as the potassium, (energy - good, too much -- bad for the kidneys), and the sugar and natural smoke flavour, (too much leading to cancer production) -- the only thing is to do what is good in everything.....M O D E R A T I O N...!<br /><br />Twice or three times a month, I allow myself to go on what I call a \"Potato Chip Diet\".  I eat only one large bag, (or the equivalent in small ones), of potato chips all day.  I supplement this with tea, coffee, and lemonade, as well as several servings of Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials, (I like the Dark Chocolate flavour)  This adds up to fewer calories than I would normally eat, if I had my normal three meals a day plus snacks.  It also teaches me to eat s-l-o-w-l-y, because that one big bag, (or many little bags), never lasts as long as I\\'d like.  Anyway, with excercise and sensible eating, the rest of the month, (and keeping my scale nearby, and weighing myself at least twice a day, every day), I\\'ve taken off ten pounds in the last three months! : )<br /><br />These BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips from KETTLE,<br />are totally scrumptious.

       "       'I\\'m surprised no one has noted how much water is in the package and how little fat (only 1.4%).  This Weruva flavor, for example, has 85% water (only 15% dry ingredients).  Here is what the FDA says on its web site:<br /><br />\"It is especially important to look at the moisture guarantee for canned foods, even when comparing a canned food with another canned. Under AAFCO regulations, the maximum percentage moisture content for a pet food is 78%, except for products labeled as a \"stew,\" \"in sauce,\" \"in gravy,\" or similar terms. The extra water gives the product the qualities needed to have the appropriate texture and fluidity. Some of these exempted products have been found to contain as much as 87.5% moisture. This doesn\\'t sound like much difference until the dry matter contents are compared. For example, a product with a guarantee of 87.5% moisture contains 12.5% dry matter, only half as much as a product with a 75% moisture guarantee (25% dry matter).\"<br /><br />On top of the nutrition problems, Weruva is ripping you off on a cost basis (this is my comment, not the FDA\\'s). Looking at the dry ingredients, Weruba is charging you about $2 per ounce ($1.60 per 0.825 oz dry ingredients in a 5.5 oz can).  The top premium cat foods charge about $1 per ounce of dry ingredients.  Avoderm is 80 cents per 1 oz dry weight.  Science Diet is less than 70 cents per oz dry weight.  So Weruva is nearly 3 times the cost for ingredients other than water comparing Science Diet.<br /><br />So if you have a lot of money to waste and don\\'t mind your cats having dry hair and other skin problems from lack of essential fats in the diet, then go for Weruva.  Otherwise, wait until they drop their price and increase the fat content.',\n",

I did my test with a special low concentration organic iodine, Iodine Trichloride.

The in-between flavors? Like grass? They\\'re largely there to confuse you, and do so wonderfully.<br /><br />To sum up my experience with them, an anecdote:<br /><br />Driving along one summer, eating said beans, my two friends convince me to eat the Booger flavoured one. \"Okay,\" I begin \"but only if you get a good flavored one ready to get the taste out of my mouth.\"<br /><br />My first friend passes me the booger-bean, and gets a grape-bean ready on deck. The booger bean was mostly flavourless... until the saliva hit my tongue! Retching, I spat out the window, and demanded the grape bean. Blargh! The dark colour tricked them! It was dirt! Spitting again, I demanded another bean. They produced another dark coloured one, this one seeming noticeably more purple in the light. Noooo! It was more dirt!<br /><br />Pulling over, and spitting out the bean, they presented me with a white one. \"Alright,\" they said \"This can only be popcorn, or marshmallow.\"<br /><br />Seeing no bad option, I took the bean and chewed it gratefully. Then I vomited in my mouth.<br /><br />It was neither popcorn, nor marshmallow. It was rotten egg!<br /><br />Suffice to say, that these are not the kind of jelly bean you buy, thinking that every one of them will be wonderful. The rotten egg, dirt, soap, and vomit beans all taste exactly what they are supposed to. And that is what makes them a fantastic product.',\n",

After reading the study for myself, I believe it is inaccurate to say the levels are too high.  The dairy formula tested below levels allowed in drinking water. The goal is reduction becasue elimination is unrealistic.  I have been mixing with some Earth's Best and may increase to a 50/50 mix until Nature's One releases more details on their testing and how they are going to adress this issue going forward.  Overall though, I still think this is the best formula on the market and I want to see Nature's One improve with this crisis, not be forced out of business.  I have bigger concerns about other formulas (organic and non organic) that have nothing to do with hexane.  To be fair, we prepare her bottles with filtered water so there is not much arsenic in that water. Our baby was breastfed for 7 months (we started supplementing the formula at 6 months) and she will continue to get about 20% of her milk as forzen breastmilk until she is 10 months old.\",\n",
